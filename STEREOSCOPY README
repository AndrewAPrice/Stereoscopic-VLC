================================================================================
Before doing anything, be warned that there is a mixture of GPL and non-GPL
software in this release, so under no circumstance should you publically
release a binary version of this software yet. The non-GPL files are:
vlc/include/nvapi.h
nvapiwrapper/nvapi.lib
nvapiwrapper/nvapiwrapper.dll
nvapiwrapper/nvapiwrapper.c
================================================================================
To build follow the standard Win32Compile instructions with a few differences.
I use 32-bit MSYS/MinGW on x64 Windows 7 Ultimate.

================================================================================
1. To bootstrap I use the following:

cd vlc
cp -v /usr/win32/share/aclocal/* m4/
cp -v /usr/share/aclocal/* m4/
PATH=/usr/win32/bin:$PATH ./bootstrap

if it fails witH

================================================================================
2. Then to configure:

sh extras/package/win32/configure-msys.sh

================================================================================
3. To build:

PATH=/usr/win32/bin:$PATH make -j6
PATH=/usr/win32/bin:$PATH make package-win32 -j6

(The -j6 switch is optional and tells makefile to use 6 threads, it speeds up
the build time on my 6-core machine.)

'make package-win32' will exit with the following error but that's normal and
VLC has still been built:

cp: cannot stat `./npapi-vlc/installed/lib/npvlc.dll': No such file or directory


================================================================================
4. Temporarily rename vlc.exe to wow.exe:

cd vlc-1.2.0-git
mv vlc.exe wow.exe

'wow.exe' can be replaced by a number of windowed-mode 3D Vision executable
names ('googleearth.exe', etc). This step is required because VLC does not yet
have a nVidia 3D Vision driver profile, and 'windowed mode' 3D Vision only
activates for programs with a driver profile. Thankfully, it's just a simple
file name check.

================================================================================
5. Copy nvapiwrapper.dll from 'nvapiwrapper' to 'vlc-1.2.0-git':

cp ../nvapiwrapper/nvapiwrapper.dll ./

This is a temporary solution. See nvapiwrapper/README for more details.

================================================================================
6. To view 3D video you manually enable stereoscopy by running VLC with:

wow --video-filter="stereoscopy" --stereoscopy-left=<left mode>            \
    --stereoscopy-right=<right mode>

<left mode> and <right mode> represent the method that particular eye is encoded
with. For example, to watch a Red/Cyan anaglyph video you would use:

wow --video-filter="stereoscopy" --stereoscopy-left=1004                   \
    --stereoscopy-right=1001

To watch a left/right side-by-side video you would use:
wow --video-filter="stereoscopy" --stereoscopy-left=2000                   \
    --stereoscopy-right=2001

The possible values are: (found in modules/video_filter/stereoscopy.h)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0     STEREOSCOPY_2D
        If either eye is this value then stereoscopy is disabled and the image
        is treated as 2D.
 1000  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_BLUE
        The eye is encoded into the blue channel of the image and returned as
        a blue image.
 1001  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_CYAN
        The eye is encoded into the blue and green channels of the image and
        returned as a cyan image.
 1002  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_GREEN
        The eye is encoded into the green channel of the image and returned
        as a green image.
 1003  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_MAGENTA
        The eye is encoded into the red and blue channels of the image and
        returned as a magenta image.
 1004  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_RED
        The eye is encoded into the red channel of the image and returned as
        a red image.
 1005  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_YELLOW
        The eye is encoded into the red and green channels of the image and
        returned as a yellow image.

 1010  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_BLUE_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the blue channel and returned as a grayscale
        image.
 1011  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_CYAN_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the blue and green channels of the image and
        returned as a grayscale image.
 1012  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_GREEN_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the green channel of the image and returned
        as a grayscale image.
 1013  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_MAGENTA_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the red and blue channels of the image and
        returned as a grayscale image.
 1014  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_RED_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the red channel of the image and returned
        as a grayscale image.
 1015  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_YELLOW_GRAY
        The eye is encoded into the red and green channels of the image and
        returned as a grayscale image.

 1021  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_CYAN_FILL
        The eye is encoded into the blue and green channels of the image and
        returned as a full colour image. The missing red channel is filled in
        with the average of the blue and green channels.
 1023  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_MAGENTA_FILL
        The eye is encoded into the red and blue channels of the image and
        returned as a full colour image. The missing green channel is filled in
        with the average of the red and blue channels.
 1025  STEREOSCOPY_ANAGLYPH_YELLOW_FILL
        The eye is encoded into the red and green channels of the image and
        returned as a full colour image. The missing blue channel is filled in
        with the average of the red and green channels.

 2000  STEREOSCOPY_SIDEBYSIDE_LEFT
        The eye is encoded into the left half of the image. Assumes the source
        is half-SBS but the aspect ratio will need to be halved for full-SBS.
 2001  STEREOSCOPY_SIDEBYSIDE_RIGHT
        The eye is encoded into the right half of the image. Assumes the source
        is half-SBS but the aspect ratio will need to be halved for full-SBS.
 2002  STEREOSCOPY_SIDEBYSIDE_BOTTOM
        Not yet implemented. Reserved for top/bottom side-by-side.
 2003  STEREOSCOPY_SIDEBYSIDE_TOP
        Not yet implemented. Reserved for top/bottom side-by-side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please only use the Direct3D vout because the other vout's are not stereoscopic
aware and will just sequentually show each eye. Also be sure to use the latest
nVidia drivers. (I have been developing with 275.22.)

The Direct3D vout does not require any configuring. If 3D Vision is detected
then it will be used. It can be enabled/disabled using the button on the
3D Vision IR dongle or by using the driver hotkey (CTRL+T by default). If 3D
Vision is turned off then it does not turn the stereoscopy filter off, so you'll
just see the left eye.
