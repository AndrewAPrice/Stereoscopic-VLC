'nvapiwrapper' is a wrapper around NvAPI, the proprietary-licensed nVidia
wrapper. nvapiwrapper wraps the nvapi.lib static library (which is a MSVC
binary) into a dynamically loadable library (nvapiwrapper.dll) that can
be used via MinGW. Compile nvapiwrapper.c with the MSVC++ compiler to
output the .dll.

This is only a temporary solution and will not remain here permanently.
